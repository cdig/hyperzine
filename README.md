An asset management system.

### Building

```
# Deps:
brew install node sass/sass/sass yarn
npm install -g coffeescript
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Run:
yarn start

# And after that's done and begins watching, in another tab run:
yarn electron
```

### Idea Bucket

Automatically check for "conflicted copy"

When adding an asset, check for node_modules and other excluded files

A way to flag assets as "favourite" â€” local to each user (computer)
