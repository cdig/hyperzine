# Hyperzine

An asset management system.

### Building

```
# Deps:
brew install node sass/sass/sass yarn
npm install -g coffeescript
git submodule update --init --recursive

# Optional â€” custom Electron build (adjust path as needed):
export ELECTRON_OVERRIDE_DIST_PATH=~/Work/electron/arm64

# Run:
yarn start

# And after that's done and begins watching, in another tab run:
yarn electron
```

### TODO

If we're gonna debounce stuff like writing files to disk, we gotta make sure we have a way to finish all that stuff before quitting, so that we don't lose any data.
