  # At this point we're done initializing. Here's what happens next:
  # * Either the config file or the Setup Assistant will specify a data folder.
  # * The assets-folder.coffee subscription will make sure we have an Assets folder in the data folder,
  #   and then call LoadAssets() to load all our asset data into memory.
  # * Concurrently with the above, the Main process will launch a Browser window.
  # * As asset data comes into existence, the Browser window will populate itself.
